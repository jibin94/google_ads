## Google Mobile Ads
[google_mobile_ads](https://pub.dev/packages/google_mobile_ads) : This plugin allows you to display banner, interstitial (full-screen), rewarded, and native ads inside your Flutter app.

### Sample template consist of : 
* Banner ads : Banner ads are rectangular ads that occupy a portion of an app's layout. They stay on screen while users are interacting with the app, either anchored at the top or bottom of the screen or inline with content as the user scrolls. Banner ads can refresh automatically after a certain period of time.
* Interstitial ads : Interstitial ads are full-screen ads that cover the interface of an app until closed by the user. They're typically displayed at natural transition points in the flow of an app, such as between activities or during the pause between levels in a game. When an app shows an interstitial ad, the user has the choice to either tap on the ad and continue to its destination or close it and return to the app.
* Rewarded ads : Rewarded ads are ads that users have the option of interacting with in exchange for in-app rewards.

### Note
- Always test with test ads. When building and testing your apps, make sure you use test ads rather than live, production ads. Failure to do so can lead to suspension of your account.
